This project implements a decision tree classifier to detect malicious network traffic using the CICIDS 2018 dataset.
It includes data preprocessing, balancing, and scaling, followed by model training and evaluation. Visualizations are provided to illustrate class distribution and model performance.

Features: <br/>
Data cleaning and preprocessing<br/>
Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler<br/>
Decision tree classifier with hyperparameter tuning<br/>
Visualizations with Plotly and Seaborn<br/>
